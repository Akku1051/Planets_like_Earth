<p>There isn't a planet quite like Earth. Nasa has discovered more than 4,000 planets outside our solar system, but has only found 59 that could be habitable. This shows us how hard it is for a planet to be able to sustain life. Here is a list of the top 10 planets might be able to support life and maybe one day we will be able to live on these planets. </p>

<h1 id="GLIESE 667CC">10) GLIESE 667CC</h1>
<img src="Gliese_667Cc.webp" width="480px" height="450px">
<p>This planet is only 22 light years away from Earth. It is around 4.5 times larger than earth, but 1 year on this planet is only 28 days because it's host star is dwarf star. However the dawarf star is much cooler than our sun so this allows GLIESE 667CC to be in the habitable zone. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 id="KEPLER-22B">9) KEPLER-22B</h1>
<img src="KEPLER_22B.webp" width="480px" height="450px">
<p>KEPLER-22B is 600 light years away. A year on this planet is 290 days. It was the first Kepler planet found in the habitable zone of it's parent star. this planet is considerable larger than Earth at around 2.4 times the size of Earth. although it is currently unclear if this planet's surface is solid, liquid, or gaseous.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 id="KEPLER-69C">8) KEPLER-69C</h1>
<img src="KEPLER-69C.webp" width="640px" height="400px">
<p>KEPLER-69C is 2700 light years away and estimated to be 70% larger than Earth, but currently researchers are unsure if it is a viable planet for life. A year on this planet is 242 days. This planet's postion in it's solar system is comparable to that of Venus, but it's host star is 80% as luminous which allows it to be in the habitable zone. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 id="KEPLER-62F">7) KEPLER-62F</h1>
<img src="KEPLER-62F.png" width="480" height="400px">
<p>KEPLER-62F is about 40% larger than Earth and orbits a star that is much cooler than our sun. One year on this planet is 267 days. While KEPLER-62F orbits much closer to its dwarf star than Earth orbits the sun, the dwarf star produces less light allowing this planet to be int he habitable zone.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 id="KEPLER-186F">6) KEPLER-186F</h1>
<img src="KEPLER-186F.jpeg">
<p>KEPLER-186F is 600 light years away from Earth and is quite simailar to it only being 10% larger than Earth. This planet orbits a dwarf star and only get one-third the sunlight Earth gets from the sun.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 id="KEPLER-442B">5) KEPLER-442B</h1>
<img src="KEPLER-442B.png">
<p>KEPLER-442B is 33% larger than Earth and takes 112 days to orbit it's host star. It is 1,194 light years away and was discoverd back in 2015. a study in 2021 found that this planet may recive a enough light to have a large biosphere. Researchers have found that sufficient sunlight to carry out photosynthesis.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 id="KEPLER-452B">4) KEPLER-452B</h1>
<img src="KEPLER-452B.jpeg" width="620px" height="400px">
<p>KEPLER-452B is the first near Earth sized planet that orbits a star simailar to the sun, with KEPLER-452B being 60% larger than Earth and it's star being 10% larger than the sun. This allows KEPLER-452B to be in the habitable zone. This planet is 1,400 light years away and a year on this planet is only 20 days more than a year on Earth.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 id="KEPLER-1649C">3) KEPLER-1649C</h1>
<img src="KEPLER-1649C.jpeg">
<p>KEPLER-1649C was discoverd when NASA's Kepler telescope was reanalyzed. The planet was found to be simailar to Earth's size and orbits the habitable zone of it's star. KEPLER-1649C is located 300 light years away and is only 1.06 times larger than Earth. It recives 75% light compared to the light Earth gets from the Sun.</p>

<h1 id="PROXIMA CENTAURI B">2) PROXIMA CENTAURI B</h1>
<img src="PROXIMA CENTAURI B.jpeg">
<p>PROXIMA CENTAURI B is just four light years away from Earth making it the closest planet on this list from us. The planet is roughly 1.27 times larger than Earth. Although this planet can be found in the habitable zone of it's star, it is exposed to ultraviolet radiation because it is so close to it's host star, due to this a year on this planet is only 11.2 days</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 id="TRAPPIST-1E">1) TRAPPIST-1E</h1>
<img src="TRAPPIST-1E.png">
<p>TRAPPIST-1E is the most Earth like planet to date, it's star is very simailar to ours, and some researchers believe that TRAPPIST-1E could have more water than all of Earth's oceans. TRAPPIST-1E is the most likey planet to be able to support life as we know it.</p>
